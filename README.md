# My NextJS Web App Prototype - BetBuds

## Introduction

Welcome to my web application prototype for an idea of mine called BetBuds! This project was created as a learning endeavor to explore and understand various technologies including NextJS, Prisma, server-side vs client-side rendering, PostgresDB, and deployment using Vercel. It's important to note that this app is very much a work in progress and serves primarily as a platform for educational exploration.

The final goal of this web app is to give friends the ability to create and join leagues with their friends where they compete in making picks for games.

## Technologies Used

- **NextJS**
- **Prisma**
- **Server vs Client Side Rendering**
